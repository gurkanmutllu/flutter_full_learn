# flutter_full_learn

## Getting Started to larning Flutter
In this repository you can find fundamental components of Flutter framework. <br>
I tried to show basic examples of most used widgets in Flutter. And i shown some <br> most used packages from pub.dev. <br> 
The files putted and sorted into folders as incremented by difficulty level (101, 202, 303...).  <br>


## 101 folder
In this folder we named files as basic Flutter widgets. Every single file has their base <br> widgets in it and their properties shown clearly. <br>
